# #461 Hamming Distance

Actually shocked by this algorithms.

## Description

The [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers `x` and `y`, calculate the Hamming distance.

**Example:**

```
Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
       ↑   ↑

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
```

## Solution

python

```python
def hammingDistance(x,y):
    return bin(x^y).count('1')
```

**Note:**

Exclusive or operator will set one bit to 1 if and only if the bits at the same position from two operands are different.

According to the description, we only need to find how many differences are there in two binary operands.

# #557 Reverse Words in a String III

Given a string, you need to reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.

## Description

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "Let's take LeetCode contest"
Output: "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"

```

**Note:** In the string, each word is separated by single space and there will not be any extra space in the string.

## Solution

python

```python
class Solution(object):
    def reverseWords(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: str
        abadon -> 6
        word[5]
        """
        collection = s.split()
        tmp_str = ""
        for word in collection:
            word = word[::-1]
            tmp_str += word
            tmp_str += " "
        tmp_str = tmp_str.strip(" ")
        return tmp_str
```

**Note:**

Daily shocked by other's solutions. Here's another solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def reverseWords_1(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        return " ".join(map(lambda x: x[::-1], s.split()))
    
    def reverseWords_2(self, s):
    	return ' '.join(x[::-1] for x in s.split())
```

It seems someone used lambda...

Here I misunderdood the function of `join()`

`'sep'.join('seq')` means it will return a string where each element in seq will be connected by sep

`[::-1]` is actually enough to reverse string, amazing
